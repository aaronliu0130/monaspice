# Monaspice HumanHandMech Nerd Font

[GitHub's innovatively spaced font](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace), with the Humanist, Handwriting and Mechanical sans variants for the normal, italic (& bold italic), and bold variants, patched with nerd font glyphs on top.

I made this by using [FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge) to change the names and weights of the individual otf fonts. Then, I used [nerd-fonts's font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher) to add in the glyphs onto all the fonts.

"Monaspace" is a reserved font name, so my version is called "Monaspice", which is not a reserved font name, thank you very much.
